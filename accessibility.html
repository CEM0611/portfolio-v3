		  <a id="HTMLCSS" name="HTMLCSS"></a><h2>HTML and CSS<h2>
		  <p>This website was built from basic HTML tags and elements with Basic CSS involved as well. Colors were chosen with Google's built-in hex color picker for its search
		  engine and HTML/CSS knowledge was obtained from w3schools resources and my COP 1500 course</p>
		  <a id="IMGVEC" name="IMGVEC"></a><h2>Images and Vectors<h2>
		  <p>The picture on the left on the main page is my portrait. The gradients and vectors
		  were made using imported code from a vector I've created myself with InkScape and the gradient was created with JavaScript.</p>
		  <a id="NAVLINK" name="NAVLINK"></a><h2>Navigation and Links<h2>
		  <p>The href and respective media tag properties were used mainly to link resources together such as the Fields Report and this accessibility section to allow for seamless navigation and
		  presentation. </p>
		  <a id="VIDSOUND" name="VIDSOUND"></a><h2>Video and Sound<h2>
		  <p>The video was taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eN58_TDA2I">here</a> using a video downloading/cropping website and I clipped it to the duration
		  that was suitable to me, used the video tag with the "muted", "loop", and "autoplay" and set it as the background of the site. The audio from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eN58_TDA2I">here</a> 
		  playing for the website was obtained using the same method, but using an youtube to mp3 download site.
		  <h2>Did you enjoy this website?</h2>
